These mods are currently under development for Minecraft 1.18 using Forge.

Depends on [Kotlin for Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kotlin-for-forge).

Most Age Series mods integrate with each other; we also sometimes interact with the [Create mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) for crafting and energy conversion and the [Cooking for Blockheads mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cooking-for-blockheads) for realistic kitchen appliances.
