## About

Chemistry Age will add some realistic chemistry simulations. It's not exactly clear how accurate they will be able to be since it's hard to enumerate all the real chemistry out there.

## (Planned) Features

* Advanced ore processing (beyond Processing Age)
* Somewhat realistic chemistry for certain common high schoo science reactions

## (Planned) Integration

* Processing Age: Materials
* Processor Age: PLC control systems
* Server Age: Monitoring and control systems
* Electrical Age: Power
