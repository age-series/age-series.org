## About

Electrical Age 2 is going to be a successor to Electrical Age for 1.7.10.

You can visit the old website [here](https://electrical-age.net/).

Electrical Age provides realistic electronics simulation using a method called Modified Nodal Analysis. It allows you to create both small circuits for basic base building in the early game as well as means to power large factories and entire worlds using high-tension power lines and realistic generation facilities of your own design!

## (Planned) Features

* Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Voltage Sources, Current Sources, and more.
* Digital and analog signals system for TTL logic at 3.3V and 5.0V
* Low pass filters, op amps, relays, sensor probes
* Solar panels, hydroelectric power, steam power, wind power
* Shaft systems with generators, motors, flywheels, steam engines, gas engines, and more!
* Lighting systems including switches and wireless controls
* Transmission systems for electricity
* RF and other mod energy _export_
* Create axle integration

## (Planned) Integrations

* Processing Age: Realistic crafting and fabrication
* Processor Age: PLA controls systems for low-latency control systems
* Chemistry Age: Advanced crafting
* Server Age: Systems monitoring for realistic grid operation
* [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create): Shaft integration, providing motors, generators, and other shaft integrations
* [Cooking for Blockheads](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cooking-for-blockheads): Realistic kitchen equipment
